**Composite Pattern**

A Composite Pattern says that just "**allow clients to operate in generic manner on objects that may or may not represent a hierarchy of objects**".

**Advantage of Composite Design Pattern**

1) It defines class hierarchies that contain primitive and complex objects.

2) It makes easier to you to add new kinds of components.

3) It provides flexibility of structure with manageable class or interface.

**Usage of Composite Pattern**

It is used:

1)When you want to represent a full or partial hierarchy of objects.

2)When the responsibilities are needed to be added dynamically to the individual objects without affecting other objects. Where the responsibility of object may vary from time to time.
