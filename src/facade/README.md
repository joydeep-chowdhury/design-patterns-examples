**Facade Pattern**

A Facade Pattern says that just "**just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client**".

In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

Practically, every **Abstract Factory is a type of Facade**.

**Advantage of Facade Pattern**

1)It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.

2)It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.

3)When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.

4)When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
